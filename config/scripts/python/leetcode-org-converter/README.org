* Introduction
This is horrible =leetcode problem to org converter=. I created it
for macos tiling sucked back then when i used it and i wanted to
improve problems appearance

* Preparation
At first, go to =~/.files-balamah= and run
#+begin_src bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
#+end_src

Then, you need to edit file =~/.files-balamah/py-scripts.ini=. It this
file, you need to change =LEETCODE_SESSION= and =LANGUAGE=. To get
=LEETCODE_SESSION=, you need to see leetcode cookies and search for
=session=.

* How it works
=ApiOutput= sends api request to leetcode using graphql and returns in
output in =dict= type. All magic happends in =Convert=. The class converts
=html= to =org= using sed

* Running
To run the converter, run command
#+begin_src shell
python3 path/to/leetcode-org-converter/main.py leetcode-problem-name
#+end_src

Instead of =leetcode-problem-name= you need to insert problem name from
problem link. Like: two-sum, merge-k-sorted-list
